  abstract       = {China has undergone rapid urbanization in the past few decades, and it has been accompanied by overdevelopment. Residential vacancies caused by overdevelopment result in a waste of resources and generate greenhouse gases associated with land surface changes. Due to the poor spatial resolution and limited availability of data, previous studies performed analyses at low resolutions at the county scale, thus lacking spatial detail. In addition, they used complicated subjective indicators difficult to apply to cities of various sizes across China. To understand the detailed spatial pattern of residential vacancies in megacities, we designed a more generally applicable approach with multisource high-resolution spatiotemporal data and tested it in Beijing, the capital of China. At first, a statistical regression with features derived from multisource data was used. Then, the predicted values of the regression function were used as standard heat values, and the observed heat value in each unit was divided by the corresponding standard heat value. Next, residential vacancies were estimated by calculating the quantiles of these division results in all analysis units. This approach requires no prior knowledge or complicated indicators and can be easily applied across cities in China, which is beneficial for development planning at the provincial and national levels.},

  abstract       = {Urban land use mapping is critical to understanding human activities in space. The first national mapping result of essential urban land use categories of China (EULUC-China) was released in 2019. However, the overall accuracies in some of the plain cities such as Beijing, Chengdu, and Zhengzhou were lower than 50% because many parcel-based mapping units are large with mixed land uses. To address this shortcoming, we proposed an area of interest (AOI)-based mapping approach, choosing Beijing as our study area. The mapping process includes two major steps. First, grids with different sizes (i.e., 300 m, 200 m, and 100 m) were derived from original land parcels to obtain classification units with a suitable size. Then, features within these grids were extracted from Sentinel-2 spectral data, point of interest (POI), and Tencent Easygo crowdedness data. These features were classified using a random forest (RF) classifier with AOI data, resulting in a 10-category map of EULUC. Second, we superimposed the AOIs layer on classified units to do some rectification and offer more details at the building scale. The overall accuracy of the AOI layer reached 98%, and the overall accuracy of the mapping results reached 77%. This study provides a fast method for accurate geographic sample collection, which substantially reduces the amount of fieldwork for sample collection and improves the classification accuracy compared to previous EULUC mapping. The detailed urban land use map could offer more support for urban planning and environmental policymaking.},

  abstract = {Land use reflects human activities on land. Urban land use is the highest level human alteration on Earth, and it is rapidly changing due to population increase and urbanization. Urban areas have widespread effects on local hydrology, climate, biodiversity, and food production. However, maps, that contain knowledge on the distribution, pattern and composition of various land use types in urban areas, are limited to city level. The mapping standard on data sources, methods, land use classification schemes varies from city to city, due to differences in financial input and skills of mapping personnel. In this communication, we report a new urban land use map for entire China that uses 10 m satellite images, OpenStreetMap, nighttime lights, POI and Tencent social big data all in 2018 as input features. A two-level classification system containing what we called Essential Urban Land Use Categories (EULUC) has been proposed. Four major procedures were involved in the mapping of EULUC in China. First, parcel generation with OSM road network and impervious boundaries. Second, feature extraction from multi-source geospatial big data. Third, crowdsourcing collection of training and validation samples involving 21 research groups in 27 selected representative cities. Fourth, mapping and accuracy assessment of EULUC-China.},
